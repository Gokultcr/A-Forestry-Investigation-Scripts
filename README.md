Please note that all the scripts provided are from the manuscript titled '[A Forestry Investigation: Exploring Factors Behind Improved Tree Species Classification Using Bark Images](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102932)'
  . While the manuscript makes use of various datasets (https://zenodo.org/communities/forestry_investigation_datasets/records) , we have included only the main scripts here. You will need to replace the datasets and other optional components, such as scaling and additional parameters, based on the instructions provided in the other scripts.
